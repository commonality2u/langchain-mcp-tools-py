    arguments, environment variables, working directory, and error logging
    options.

    Attributes:
        command: The executable command to run (e.g., "npx", "uvx", "python").

        env: Optional dictionary of environment variables to set for the
            process.
        cwd: Optional working directory where the command will be executed.
